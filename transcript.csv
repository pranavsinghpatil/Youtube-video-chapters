0.04,"My name is Alexandr Wang, and I am 
the founder and CEO of Scale AI."
3.64,Alexandr Wang co-founded a company that supplies
6.08,"one crucial resource that 
tech giants need: humans."
9.72,"His company Scale AI supplies 
high-quality training data to NVIDIA,"
14.0,"OpenAI, General Motors, Microsoft, and Meta."
17.44,"This data improves language models like 
ChatGPT and supports applications in the field."
22.4,"For instance, Scale’s human workers combined with 
AI tools help GM’s self-driving unit Cruise by"
28.4,"labeling data to differentiate a pedestrian from 
a palm tree or a puddle from a manhole cover."
34.16,"They also label behaviors, such as predicting 
whether a person is about to cross the street."
38.8,"All of this helps AI systems 
make safer decisions on the road."
42.64,"Alexandr co-founded Scale AI in 
2016 at the age of 19, just when"
47.52,"AI technology was beginning to take off.
Before that, at 17, he was already coding"
52.48,"for the question-and-answer site 
Quora, where CEO Adam D’Angelo"
56.2,"advised him that while four years of college 
was overrated, two years might be valuable."
61.72,"Alexandr ended up dropping out of MIT after his 
freshman year, where he had been studying computer"
66.76,"science and math, to start Scale AI with fellow 
Quora alumni, Lucy Guo with an investment from"
71.6,"the startup accelerator Y Combinator.
Alexandr initially told his parents"
75.72,"it was just a summer project.
But deep down, he knew it had"
79.16,"the potential to become something far bigger.
He and Lucy recognized that self-driving car"
83.68,"companies had amassed millions of miles of 
driving footage to train their AI systems,"
88.28,"yet lacked the human power to review and label 
the data—tasks that machines can’t handle."
94.12,"Scale AI stepped in to meet that demand.
It was like striking gold in the digital age."
99.56,"Even Alexander’s first name has a touch 
of serendipity—spelled with eight letters,"
104.0,"considered lucky in Chinese culture because eight 
(“ba”) rhymes with prosperity or wealth, (“fa”)."
110.4,"One of the early believers in Alexandr and Lucy’s 
vision was Accel partner Dan Levine who not only"
115.64,"invested $4.5 million in seed funding but also 
offered his basement as Scale's first office."
121.6,"Major investors later jumped on board, 
with Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm"
125.28,"Founders Fund investing $100 million in 2019.
Lucy ended up parting ways with Scale AI,"
131.52,"reportedly due to differing visions between 
her and Alexandr, though the specific"
135.44,"reasons have never been publicly disclosed.
Today, Scale AI is valued at $14 billion,"
141.56,"with Alexandr owning an estimated 15% 
of the company, making him one of the"
145.8,"youngest self-made billionaires.
Initially, the company relied on"
150.0,"outsourcing agencies in Southeast Asia and Africa 
to hire workers for data labeling but realized"
155.2,"managing this in-house was more cost-effective.
In 2017, Scale AI quietly launched Remotasks,"
162.32,"which now employs over 240,000 
workers across 90 countries,"
166.6,"including Kenya, the Philippines, and Venezuela.
They work out of internet cafes or leased offices."
172.84,"While Scale AI doesn’t openly advertise 
its connection to Remotasks, the platform"
177.56,"has faced accusations of operating digital 
sweatshops, where workers have reported being"
182.4,"paid far below the local minimum wage, with some 
earning less than $1 a day for certain tasks."
188.2,"Despite these allegations, Scale AI 
has stated that they are “proud to"
191.96,"pay rates at a living wage.”
Some of its workers are now"
195.32,"tasked with more complex responsibilities.
Instead of simply labeling pre-existing data"
200.64,"sourced from the internet, they help 
create new data to teach models how to"
204.64,"generate images or complete text, like in ChatGPT.
For example, if I showed an AI system photos of my"
211.16,"dog, Luffy, it might generate a sentence like:
This dog is adorable and sweet and happy."
216.88,"While factually accurate, it doesn’t sound 
like something a person would naturally say."
221.44,"A human labeler might edit it to 
sound more conversational, like:"
224.92,"This sweet, adorable dog 
looks so happy and playful."
228.72,But Scale AI hasn't just focused on everyday tech.
231.52,"The company has pivoted toward military contracts.
Scale AI has been supporting U.S. military"
237.24,"operations by analyzing satellite images to 
assess damage in Ukraine caused by Russian bombs."
243.0,"To ensure sensitive data is handled securely, 
the company employs U.S. workers for data"
248.04,"labeling at its St. Louis office, though 
most of its workforce remains global."
252.68,"Alexandr was inspired to take 
action after a 2019 trip to China,"
256.88,"where he watched the country’s top engineers give 
presentations on AI and was left feeling uneasy."
262.96,He later told Forbes: “They were really dodgy
265.48,"on what the use cases were. You 
could tell it was for no good.”"
269.32,"China has accelerated its investment 
in AI technologies, for example in"
273.4,"autonomous drone swarms that operate like 
a swarm of bees to incapacitate the enemy."
278.68,"If we don’t win on AI, we risk ceding 
global influence, technological leadership,"
283.52,"and democracy to strategic adversaries like China.
For him, the mission to protect America is deeply"
290.16,"personal. He grew up near the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in New Mexico, where both his parents"
295.48,"worked as nuclear physicists.
The lab is famous for developing"
299.04,"the atomic bomb during WWII.
Just as the atomic bomb defined"
303.32,"the last era of warfare, he believes AI 
now represents the future of defense."
308.8,"Military implementations of AI are going to be 
incredibly important. We need to ensure in this"
312.88,"next phase that the U.S. is both economically 
dominant but also has military leadership as"
318.88,"well when it comes to artificial intelligence.
Alexandr advocates for centralizing military-ready"
324.48,"AI datasets, such as satellite imagery, 
intelligence reports, and sensor data—critical"
330.24,"information not readily available on the internet.
Despite the U.S. Department of Defense generating"
335.72,"22 terabytes of data daily—far more than 
China’s People’s Liberation Army—a large"
341.12,"portion remains underutilized, often stored on 
hard drives that end up forgotten or overwritten."
346.92,"He emphasizes the need to centralize 
this data into a single repository"
351.24,"where it can be processed, labeled, 
and made AI-ready for military use."
355.6,"Data truly is the ammunition that will power
our future efforts in the military."
361.92,"Although Scale AI has established a strong lead in 
AI-powered data labeling, its approach—hiring and"
367.2,"managing data labelers—can be easily replicated.
Other companies, such as Surge AI, Labelbox,"
373.24,"and Snorkel AI, are already 
stepping into the same space."
377.12,"But Alexandr is confident that Scale 
AI maintains a significant advantage."
381.96,"He told Forbes, “I would say that we’ve 
been working on this problem longer and"
385.56,"have built more technology than anyone else.”
Scale’s edge may come from Alexandr himself."
391.44,"William Hockey, the billionaire co-founder 
of fintech company Plaid who sits on"
395.36,"Scale’s board, said this to Forbes:
“Wang didn’t get to where he is because"
399.24,"he’s a boy genius—MIT pumps out a lot of teenage 
dropouts. He has an absolutely insane work ethic.”"
407.28,"But for Alexandr, hard work alone isn't enough."
410.2,"His leadership emphasizes 'active 
thinking'—constantly questioning"
414.44,"assumptions and testing ideas with data.
As he explained in a memo to his team: Ensure to"
420.04,"ask questions, challenge assumptions, and identify 
where the real bottlenecks and constraints are. It"
425.64,"is the only way you will be able to sort through 
the noise to identify the reasons you failed."
430.44,"Alexandr warns against 'nice syndrome,' 
where large groups avoid challenging"
434.32,"important ideas for fear of seeming impolite.
He advocates for a culture that promotes"
439.16,"questioning assumptions on critical issues, 
ensuring that ideas are rigorously tested."
444.76,"None of Alexandr’s success would have 
been possible without mastering coding."
